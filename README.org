First, [[https://www.goodreads.com/api/keys][get your API keys]].

Usage:

*Recommended*: create =secrets.py= keeping your api parameters, e.g.:

    
:    user_id = "USER_ID"
:    key = "KEY"


After that, use: ~./export.py --secrets /path/to/secrets.py~
That way you type less and have control over where you keep your plaintext tokens/passwords.

*Alternatively*, you can pass parameters directly, e.g. ~./export.py --user_id <user_id> --key <key>~.
However, this is verbose and prone to leaking your keys in shell history.
    
You can also import ~export.py~ this as a module and call ~get_xml~ function directly to get raw XML.
